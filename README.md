# RoundUp Backend

RoundUp is a backend service that automatically rounds up every UPI transaction and transfers the spare change into a dedicated investment account. Built entirely in Go, the backend is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, providing a robust foundation for a seamless financial savings experience.

## Features

- **UPI Integration:** Securely link and interact with UPI payment APIs.
- **Automatic Transaction Rounding:** Calculate and transfer the spare change from each transaction.
- **User Management:** Handle registration, authentication, and user profile management.
- **Dashboard Data Aggregation:** Aggregate transaction data for visual feedback on savings progress.
- **Notification Service:** Trigger alerts and notifications when milestones are achieved.
- **Modular Architecture:** A well-defined separation of concerns across different layers.
- **High Scalability:** Designed to handle high transaction volumes efficiently.

## Architecture

### API Layer

- **HTTP Server & Routing:** Utilizes Gin for routing HTTP requests.
- **Middleware:** Handles authentication, logging, and error management.
- **Handlers:** Direct incoming requests to the appropriate service after performing basic validations.

### Service Layer

- **Transaction Service:** Manages transaction processing, including the calculation of round-up amounts and transfer of spare change.
- **User Management Service:** Oversees user registration, login, and profile updates.
- **Dashboard Service:** Aggregates data from various services to display real-time savings metrics.
- **Notification Service:** Manages user notifications based on events like savings milestones.

### Data Access Layer

- **Models & Entities:** Defines core data structures such as `User`, `Transaction`, and `SavingsAccount` using Go structs.
- **Repository Pattern:** Abstracts CRUD operations to ensure a separation between business logic and data persistence.
- **Database Integration:** Connects to SQL/NoSQL databases using Go drivers, with robust transaction management and connection pooling.

### External Integrations

- **UPI Gateway Module:** A dedicated module to securely interact with UPI APIs for transaction validation and processing.
- **Third-Party Services:** Encapsulates integrations with additional external services such as notification providers.

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Configuration Management:** Uses environment variables or configuration files to manage sensitive data (API keys, DB credentials).
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Implements structured logging and integrates monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for performance tracking.
- **Containerization:** Dockerizes the application to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across environments.
- **Testing:** Includes unit tests for core services and integration tests for API endpoints.

### Security Considerations

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implements secure authentication using JWT or OAuth2.
- **Data Encryption:** Ensures encryption of sensitive data both in transit (TLS) and at rest.
- **Input Validation:** Enforces strict validation and sanitization of incoming data to mitigate common vulnerabilities.
